Update Bits

Given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M
(e g , M becomes a substring of N start from i to j)

In the function, the numbers N and M will given in decimal, you should also return a decimal number.
You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M=10011ï¼Œ you can assume that there are at 
least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j=3 and i=2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.

Example 1:
Input: N=(10000000000)2 M=(10101)2 i=2 j=6
Output: N=(10001010100)2

Example 2:
Input: N=(10000000000)2 M=(11111)2 i=2 j=6
Output: N=(10001111100)2

        int b = (1 << i)-1;

        int mask = a | b;
